            <h1 class="sub-headings"> types of web browsers</h1>
            <h4>1. Google chrome</h4>
            <p><a><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>
                is the most popular browser that people use today. The main reason for this is its speed. It’s a fast browser. It opens quickly and loads multiple tabs and pages in just one click. It’s probably the fastest browser available today. If you’re tired of waiting for
                 your browser to open after clicking on its icon, you should switch to Chrome.</a></p>
             <p>
                Another reason for using Chrome is its simplicity. It combines the address bar and Google search bar in one omnibox and lets the users have an easy experience. Apart from these advantages, it is also easily customizable and comes with a range of apps and themes
                . You can add different extensions to increase productivity.
             </p>
             <p>
                And you can sign into Chrome using your Google account and your data will be synced across all your Google devices. All these features make Chrome the number one choice for many people.
                 However, since it needs a lot of memory to run and it’s Google-based, many people prefer not to use Chrome.
             </p>
               
             <h4>2. mozilla Firefox</h4>
            <p><a><a href="https://www.Mozzila.org">Firefox</a>
                was slower than Chrome. And this is why it stayed the second choice for many people. But that was several versions ago. The new Firefox is faster and smoother.
                 If you don’t like Chrome because it’s a Google based product, you can switch to Firefox.</a></p>
             <p>
                 <p><li>Another disavantage about Firefox is that it drains battery than Chrome</li></p>
            
                 <h4>3. Opera(Opera Mini)</h4>
                 <p><a><a href="https://www.opera.com">Opera</a>
                     was slower than Chrome. And this is why it stayed the second choice for many people. But that was several versions ago. The new Firefox is faster and smoother.
                      If you don’t like Chrome because it’s a Google based product, you can switch to Firefox.</a></p>
                  <p>
                      <p>Opera can be synced across multiple devices. It allows you to customize the browser but there aren’t many options. There is a dark mode and some themes. 
                          The customization options are far less than Firefox and Chrome</p>
                  <h4>4. Apple safari</h4>
                 <p><a><a href="https://www.apple.com/safari">apple safari</a>
                    is a simple and clean browser with several features that make it a popular choice. 
                    It offers all the basic functionalities – the ability to open multiple tabs, easy bookmarking, fast speeds, and a plugin library </p>    
                     <h4>5. Kingpin browser</h4>
                    <p><a><a href="https://www.Kingpinbrowser.com">Kingpinbrowser</a>
                        is a relatively new name in the market but it’s fast gaining popularity, thanks to its no-data-stored approach.
                         It is just like one of the top browsers with all the features. Except that it always works incognito.</p>
                         <p><li>Another amazing thing about this browser is that is that the browser does not keep user history.
                             So for does who like going incognito, here a good option for you'all
                         </li></p>

                         <h4>6. Tor</h4>
                         <p><a href="https://www.tor.com">Tor</a>
                            You might think Tor might speed up in the future. But that’s not really possible. The reason why Tor is slow is that it skips data over many nodes so your real IP stays hidden.
                             That’s why people love it. to increase the speed, the data will travel directly from the home node to destination, killing the entire purpose of Tor</p>

            <h1 class="sub-headings"> the diffrence between a website and a webapp(web-application)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph"><h3>a website</h3>A website is a static page on the Internet which isn't very functional. Its main purpose is to provide an end user with some particular information. Users in most cases do nothing but read (or watch or listen to) the information which a website contains.
                 The brightest examples of typical websites are news, recipes, weather, blog portal. While <h3>A web application</h3>
                 A web app is an interactive page. It allows users to input, get and manipulate data in different ways with the help of interaction.
                  Such software programs usually have a very tight connection with the server and send lots of requests to it</p>
